# To Learn

* release process
* study github.com/swizzlevixen/letterbxd/tree/master
* How to do an API call in python
* what a fixture is pytest


## What tools do DevOps use?

Git: convenient version control for local coding (GitHub for online stuff)

Docker: A tool that builds containers, which allow for more CI than VMs. 
- [ ] Do an example in Docker
- [ ] Do an example in Kubernetes (container orchestrator)

Jenkins (or Travis CI): Automatically builds, tests, deploys new code commits (on different OSs too!)
- [ ] Do an example in Jenkins

Unittest: A Python-native testing framework. 
- [X] Develop a project using TDD and unittest. 

PyTest: a testing framework for python (simpler than unittest)
- [ ] Incorporate pytest code (within the funnction they test bc simple??) and TDD philosophy into the coding project.
- [ ] Write/calculate code coverage

Django: A framework used for developing the full stack to complicated, dynamic web applications that receive lots of traffic. (Monolithic?)
- [ ] Use Django on project? Maybe flask‚Ä¶

Flask: A lightweight framework for developing simple, static web applications. (Micro services?)
- [ ] Or maybe use Flask on the project. 

Chef: A tool written in Ruby that helps control environments with lots of different nodes and servers. 

## Project Ideas ü§ñ
* Typwritten Poem generator web app. 
* Fomo: an app that takes your zip code and shows you dog parks and trails and nearby opportunities to touch grass
* Tell Me: a web app where you log in and select your mood and it tells you how many people near you (or in the world) are also feeling that way
