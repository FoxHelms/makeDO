# DevOps Engineer Research

## What is a DevOps Engineer?

They are the support class on web app teams. Their job is to combine the code that everyone is writing into the official "source" without the service going down. 



# To Learn

* Experience developing Python-based micro-services (vs monolith!) using Django/Flask
* code analysis, release process, and code coverage
* Look at web based apps on GH to study folder structure of micro services. 


## What tools do DevOps use?

Git: convenient version control for local coding (GitHub for online stuff)
- [ ] Build repo using git on desktop
- [ ] Push to GitHub from terminal (brownie points üç∞)

Docker: A tool that builds containers, which allow for more CI than VMs. 
- [ ] Do an example in Docker
- [ ] Do an example in Kubernetes (container orchestrator)

Jenkins (or Travis CI): Automatically builds, tests, deploys new code commits (on different OSs too!)
- [ ] Do an example in Jenkins

PyTest: a testing framework for python (simpler than unittest)
- [ ] Incorporate pytest code (within the funnction they test bc simple??) and TDD philosophy into the coding project.

Django: A framework used for developing the backend to web applications that receive lots of traffic. 
- [ ] Use Django on project

Chef: A tool written in Ruby that helps control environments with lots of different nodes and servers.
